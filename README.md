# ProxyVPN
This project is a Python-based simulation designed to test whether a web application exhibits key cloud-native characteristicsâ€”redundancy, resiliency, and least privilege. The simulated application represents a Squid VPN Server running as multiple pods (containers), allowing interactive testing of scaling, fault recovery, and security principles.
